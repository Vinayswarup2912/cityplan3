        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Welcome to my Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) portfolio. This course has helped me understand the foundational principles behind algorithm design, optimization techniques, and their applications in solving real-world problems. The practical exercises have provided me with a deeper understanding of space and time complexity, as well as the importance of efficient problem-solving approaches.</p>

        <h2>2. Course Project Introduction</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>For our course project, our team worked on solving problems related to efficient graph algorithms, sorting and searching techniques, and optimization strategies. We focused on analyzing city traffic systems, optimizing data flow, and improving route selection algorithms. Our findings, along with the business case and team details, are discussed further in this section.</p>

            <h3>Reflections from Team Members</h3>
            <div class="team-member">
                <h4>Member 1: Recursion</h4>
                <p>Recursion has been one of the most intriguing topics for me. I learned how to break complex problems into smaller subproblems, which can be solved more efficiently. Understanding the base case and recursive case is key to writing recursive algorithms.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="team-member">
                <h4>Member 2: Space/Time Efficiency</h4>
                <p>Space and time efficiency are crucial when designing algorithms. I have learned to analyze the trade-offs between time complexity and space complexity to optimize the performance of algorithms.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="team-member">
                <h4>Member 3: Design Principles</h4>
                <p>The design principles of algorithms, such as divide and conquer, greedy approaches, and dynamic programming, were vital in solving problems effectively. These principles helped us achieve efficient solutions to real-world problems.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="team-member">
                <h4>Member 4: Graph Algorithms</h4>
                <p>Graph algorithms were fascinating to study, especially when applied to network flow and optimization problems. I gained insights into traversal techniques like DFS and BFS and their application in solving real-world routing issues.</p>
