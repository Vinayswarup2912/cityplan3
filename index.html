        <h1>Welcome to the DAA Portfolio</h1>
        <p>This portfolio showcases the work done during the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course, including reflections on key learning areas and project details.</p>

    <!-- Project Overview Section -->
    <section id="project-overview">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The project is focused on solving a specific problem in the domain of city planning. It involves analyzing various business cases and applying algorithmic techniques to optimize the design. The problem space was identified through extensive research and white paper findings.</p>
        <p>The business cases were divided among the team members based on their strengths and interests. Each member worked on a different aspect, from data structures to algorithm implementation.</p>

    <!-- Course Reflections Section -->
    <section id="course-reflections">
        <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
        <h3>Key Learning Areas</h3>
        <p>Throughout this course, we have studied various types of problems, including those related to iteration, recursion, and backtracking. We've also explored space and time efficiency, which are crucial when solving large-scale problems.</p>
        <p>The course has introduced us to several important data structures like trees (BST, AVL, etc.), graphs, and arrays, along with algorithmic techniques such as sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.</p>
        <p>In addition, we've reflected on design principles, such as breaking down a problem into smaller components and balancing trade-offs between simplicity and optimization in our solutions.</p>
